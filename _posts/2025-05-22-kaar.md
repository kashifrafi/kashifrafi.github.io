# Introducing KAAR AI-Powered Kubernetes Cluster Analysis and Remediation

**KAAR** (Kubernetes AI-powered Analysis and Remediation), a tool that automates Kubernetes Pod issue detection and resolution using **k8sgpt** and **AWS Bedrock**. 

In this post, I’ll introduce KAAR, explain its value, and guide you on getting started with it.

---

## The Kubernetes Pod Challenge

Pods are the core of Kubernetes, but they often encounter issues that halt your applications:

- **ImagePullBackOff**: Pods fail to start due to invalid or inaccessible container images.  
- **CrashLoopBackOff**: Containers crash repeatedly from misconfigured commands or errors like “executable file not found.”  
- **OOMKilled**: Pods are terminated for exceeding memory limits.  
- **Pending**: Pods can’t schedule due to resource constraints or node affinity issues.

Manually debugging these with `kubectl describe` and `logs` is time-consuming, especially in large clusters. 

**KAAR automates** this process, leveraging AI to resolve Pod issues quickly and reliably, saving valuable time for DevOps teams.

## What is KAAR?

KAAR is an open-source tool designed to simplify Kubernetes Pod management. It integrates:

- **k8sgpt**: A diagnostic tool that scans Kubernetes clusters for Pod issues.  
- **AWS Bedrock**: Uses the Claude v2 model to classify issues and recommend fixes.  
- **AWS SNS and CloudWatch**: Sends notifications and logs results for team visibility.  
- **kubectl**: Applies automated fixes to get Pods back on track.

KAAR is perfect for DevOps engineers, SREs, and architects who want to minimize manual intervention. It currently focuses on Pod remediation, with plans to support **Services** and **Deployments** in future releases.

## How KAAR Works

KAAR follows a streamlined, AI-powered workflow to fix Pod issues:

1. **Cluster Scanning**: KAAR uses k8sgpt to analyze your cluster and identify Pod issues.
2. **Issue Classification**: Findings are processed by AWS Bedrock to determine issue type.
3. **Remediation**: Applies fixes via `kubectl`, like updating images or adjusting limits.
4. **Verification**: Ensures Pods are Running and healthy.
5. **Notification**: Logs results to CloudWatch and sends SNS notifications.

## Real-World Examples

### Scenario 1: CrashLoopBackOff

A Pod `nginx-pod` is stuck due to an invalid command. KAAR:

- Detects the issue with k8sgpt.  
- Uses Bedrock to classify it as CrashLoopBackOff.  
- Updates the Pod’s command.  
- Verifies it is Running.  
- Sends an SNS alert:  
  > “Pod nginx-pod in default is Healthy.”

---

### Scenario 2: OOMKilled

A Pod `memory-hog` is terminated for low memory. KAAR:

- Identifies the OOMKilled issue.  
- Increases the memory limit.  
- Confirms stability.  
- Sends an alert:  
  > “Pod memory-hog in default is Healthy.”

Python 3.11 with boto3 and pyyaml:
## Why Choose KAAR?

KAAR offers compelling benefits for Kubernetes admins:

- **Time Savings**: Automates remediation.  
- **Accuracy**: AI-driven classification and suggestions.  
- **AWS Integration**: Works with Bedrock, SNS, CloudWatch.  
- **Future-Ready**: Coming support for Services and Deployments.

As an AWS Community Builder, I built KAAR to reflect AWS’s commitment to automation and innovation.

## Getting Started with KAAR

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have:

 **Kubernetes Cluster**: AWS EKS, minikube, or kind.  
   ```bash
   minikube start --driver=docker
   kubectl get nodes
   ```
 **AWS Credentials**:
  ```bash
  aws configure
  ```
 **Python 3.11 with boto3 and pyyaml**:
  ```bash
  python3.11 -m venv python311_env
  source python311_env/bin/activate
  pip install boto3 pyyaml
 ```
---

**Install KAAR via pip**:
 ```bash
 pip install kaar
 ```

**Create my_config.yaml**:
 ```bash
 aws:
  region: us-east-1
  sns_topic_arn: arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID:KAARAlerts
  log_group: /kaar/notifications
  log_stream: kaar-notifier

k8sgpt:
  backend: amazonbedrock
  explain: true

bedrock:
  model: anthropic.claude-v2:1
  max_tokens: 50
  temperature: 0.5

remediation:
  max_attempts: 5
  retry_interval_seconds: 5
```

## Future Plans

KAAR is poised to become a comprehensive Kubernetes management tool. Planned enhancements include:
- Service Remediation: Support for issues like SelectorMismatch and LoadBalancerPending.
- Deployment Support: Fixes for Deployment misconfigurations.
- EventBridge Integration: Scheduled runs for proactive monitoring, inspired by my KAAR project.
- Local LLMs: Support for Ollama as an alternative to Bedrock.
