# Amazon VPC Lattice: Simplifying Application Networking  

Amazon VPC Lattice is a fully managed application networking service built directly into AWS infrastructure. It helps connect, secure, and monitor your services across multiple AWS accounts and virtual private clouds (VPCs).  

With **Amazon EKS**, you can use **VPC Lattice** through the **AWS Gateway API Controller**, which follows standard Kubernetes Gateway API specifications. This setup simplifies cross-cluster connectivity while maintaining consistent Kubernetes semantics.

## Key Features of Amazon VPC Lattice  

### 1. Service Directory  
The **Service Directory** is an account-level catalog where all your services are organized in one place. It provides a centralized view of:  
- Your services.  
- Services shared with you.  

For instance, a service might route traffic on port 80 (HTTP) but could use different rules (like path or query parameters) to send traffic to various targets, such as:  
- Kubernetes pods.  
- AWS Lambda functions.  

### 2. Service Network  
A **Service Network** is a logical layer that connects services across different VPCs and accounts. It simplifies networking by:  
- Automatically handling **service discovery** and **connectivity**.  
- Managing access and observability policies.  
- Supporting HTTP, HTTPS, and gRPC protocols.  

When a VPC is part of a service network, clients in that VPC can automatically discover available services via DNS and communicate through VPC Lattice. **AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM)** is used to control which accounts and VPCs can communicate within the network.

### 3. Service Policies  
Service policies let you manage observability, access, and traffic control. These policies help:  
- Control who can access your services.  
- Define how traffic is handled.  
- Assign IAM roles for authorizing requests (similar to S3 or IAM policies).  

Policies can be applied at both the service and service network levels for consistent and secure access rules.  

### 4. Services in VPC Lattice  
A **service** in VPC Lattice is any independently deployable unit (like a Kubernetes pod, virtual machine, or Lambda function) that performs a specific task.  

Each service has a configuration that includes:  
- **Listeners**: Define the port and protocol (e.g., HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTPS, or gRPC) the service accepts traffic on.  
- **Rules**: Specify conditions for routing traffic (e.g., priority, path, or query-based routing).  
- **Target Groups**: Collections of resources (like EC2 instances, IP addresses, Lambda functions, or Kubernetes pods) that receive traffic based on the rules.  

For Kubernetes workloads, VPC Lattice uses the **AWS Gateway Controller** to direct traffic to services and pods efficiently.

## How Amazon VPC Lattice Works  

1. **Enable Your VPC**: Add your VPC to a service network.  
2. **Service Discovery**: Clients in the VPC automatically find services using DNS.  
3. **Route Traffic**: All inter-application traffic flows through VPC Lattice.  
4. **Control Access**: Use IAM-based policies for traffic authorization and management.

## Benefits of Amazon VPC Lattice  
- **Simplified Networking**: No need to manage complex network configurations.  
- **Cross-VPC Communication**: Easy connectivity between services across VPCs and accounts.  
- **Secure**: Apply consistent security policies using IAM.  
- **Versatile**: Supports various compute types, including containers, virtual machines, and serverless. 

By leveraging Amazon VPC Lattice, you can streamline application networking while maintaining high security and performance across your AWS environment.  



Relationship between VPC Lattice and Kubernetes
As a Kubernetes user, you can have a very Kubernetes-native experience using the VPC Lattice APIs. The following figure illustrates how VPC Lattice objects connect to Kubernetes Gateway API  objects:
